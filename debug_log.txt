The `transactions` table appears to contain information about orders, customers, products, and shipping details, but it does not contain any information about inventory management policies or write-offs.

To answer questions about company policies, you would need to refer to internal company documents, policy manuals, or consult with management. This kind of information is typically not stored in transactional databases.

If you have a different question that relates to the data available in the `transactions` table, I'd be happy to help you formulate an appropriate SQL query.

[2025-05-22 10:11:33] Policy Answer: Based on the provided documents, Dataco's policy on inventory write-offs includes the following key points:

1. Authorization Process:
   - An Obsolete Inventory Committee must be convened by the Accounting Officer or delegated authority. This committee should include representatives from Finance, Operations, Supply Chain, and Asset Management.

2. Write-Off Approval Thresholds:
   - Up to $5,000: Department Manager can approve
   - $5,001-$25,000: Director of Operations can approve
   - Above $25,000: CEO and CFO approval required

3. Conditions for Write-Offs:
   Write-offs may be approved when items:
   - Have expired and are redundant
   - Are of specialized nature and outdated due to newer products
   - Cannot be used for original intended purposes
   - Have been damaged and rendered useless

4. Financial Considerations:
   - The Finance department must assess tax implications of write-offs
   - Accounting treatments must comply with GAAP/IFRS standards

5. Documentation:
   - All identified obsolete inventory must be documented by the Storeman and verified by the Asset Accountant
   - Documentation must include item description, SKU, original purchase date and cost, reason for obsolescence, current condition, and recommended disposal method

6. Reporting:
   - Quarterly reports must be generated on total obsolete inventory value, disposal methods used, financial impact, and prevention effectiveness
   - An annual review of the policy should be conducted to update procedures based on lessons learned

This policy aims to ensure proper authorization, documentation, and financial handling of inventory write-offs while minimizing financial losses and ensuring efficient use of resources.

[2025-05-25 18:34:09] Policy Answer: Based on the provided documents, it appears that DataCo Global has established a clear policy regarding supplier selection, evaluation, and management.

Regarding your question, I found no specific information in the documents that explicitly addresses suppliers who don't meet minimum ethical sourcing requirements or their percentage of total spend. However, I can provide some insights based on the policies:

1. **Supplier Pre-Qualification Criteria**: Suppliers must provide a valid business license, registration, and certifications specific to the product/service category. Suppliers with a minimum annual revenue of USD 1 million for the last fiscal year are required.
2. **Supplier Selection Process**: Suppliers scoring below 70/100 in the pre-qualification checklist are automatically disqualified.

Given these criteria, it is possible that some suppliers may not meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements as defined in the Supplier Code of Conduct. However, without further information or specific data on the number of suppliers meeting these requirements, I cannot provide a percentage of total spend for non-compliant suppliers.

To answer your question more accurately, I would recommend reviewing additional documentation, such as procurement reports, supplier performance metrics, and audit results, to determine the percentage of total spend represented by suppliers that don't meet minimum ethical sourcing requirements.
[2025-05-25 19:11:25] Generated SQL: To answer this question, we need to identify suppliers that don't meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements. This information is not provided in the given schema, so I will assume that such information is stored in a separate table "suppliers" with columns "supplier_id", "name", and "meets_ethical_sourcing_requirements".

Here's an example of how you might structure this table:

| supplier_id | name | meets_ethical_sourcing_requirements |
|------------|------|-----------------------------------|
| 1          | ABC Inc. | 0                               |
| 2          | XYZ Corp. | 1                               |
| 3          | DEF Co.   | 0                               |

Next, we can join this table with the "transactions" table to get a count of the total spend for each supplier that doesn't meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements.

Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.name,
    COUNT(t.order_item_id) AS total_spend,
    ROUND(COUNT(t.order_item_id) * 100.0 / (
        SELECT 
            SUM(oit.order_item_total)
        FROM 
            transactions oit
        WHERE 
            oit.meets_ethical_sourcing_requirements = 1
    ), 2) AS percentage_of_total_spend
FROM 
    suppliers s
JOIN 
    transactions t ON s.supplier_id = t.supplier_id
WHERE 
    s.meets_ethical_sourcing_requirements = 0
GROUP BY 
    s.name
```

This query will give you a list of suppliers that don't meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements, along with their total spend and the percentage of your total spend they represent.
[2025-05-25 19:14:09] Generated SQL: To answer this question, we'll need to analyze the `transactions` table to identify suppliers that don't meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements. Let's assume a new column `compliance_status` has been added to the `transactions` table with values either 'Compliant' or 'Non-Compliant'.

Here's the SQL query to solve this problem:
```sql
WITH non_compliant_suppliers AS (
  SELECT supplier_id, 
         SUM(spend) AS total_spend
  FROM transactions
  WHERE compliance_status = 'Non-Compliant'
  GROUP BY supplier_id
)
SELECT 
  nc.supplier_id,
  ROUND(nc.total_spend / (SELECT SUM(spend) FROM transactions), 2) AS percentage_of_total_spend
FROM non_compliant_suppliers nc;
```
Here's what the query does:

1. The Common Table Expression (CTE) `non_compliant_suppliers` selects suppliers that don't meet the minimum ethical sourcing requirements (`compliance_status = 'Non-Compliant'`) and calculates their total spend.
2. The main query joins the CTE with a subquery that sums up the total spend for all suppliers to get the overall spend.
3. It then calculates the percentage of total spend represented by each non-compliant supplier using the `ROUND` function.

Note: You'll need to replace `supplier_id` and `spend` with the actual column names in your table, as well as ensure that the `compliance_status` column exists and has the expected values.
